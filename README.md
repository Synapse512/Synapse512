Hello, I am 16 and from NC  

I enjoy coding scripts in Powershell, C++, and Lua. I think its very fun and satisfying. 

I also love developing games in Roblox, where I get to work with graphics, physics, and programming Server/Client systems.   

While I am not highly skilled in programming yet, I am working towards bettering my skills everyday. I aspire to be able to work in a programming career someday.
