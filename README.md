Hello, I am a 16 year old Early College student from NC. 

I have experience in coding with PowerShell, C++, and Lua. I find it to be very fun and satisfying. 

I also love developing games in Roblox, where I get to work with aspects like graphics, physics, client-server systems, and other parts of the engine. My games have amassed over 6 million plays from over 2 million users, and have helped me learn about real-time systems, collaboration, large scale data storage, and more. 

I am working towards bettering my skills in programming every day, as I aspire to eventually be able to work in a programming career
